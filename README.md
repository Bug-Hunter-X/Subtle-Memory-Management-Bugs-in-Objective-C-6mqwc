# Subtle Memory Management Bugs in Objective-C

This repository demonstrates common, yet often difficult-to-detect, memory management errors in Objective-C. The examples highlight incorrect usage of `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease`, leading to memory leaks and crashes. Understanding these issues is vital for building robust and stable Objective-C applications.

**Bug Description:**

The `MemoryManagementBug.m` file contains code that showcases scenarios like forgetting to release objects after use, resulting in memory leaks, and double-releasing objects, causing unexpected program termination.

**Solution:**

The `MemoryManagementSolution.m` file provides corrected versions of the buggy code, demonstrating appropriate memory management techniques.  It includes detailed comments explaining the fixes and best practices.
