In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error involves incorrect usage of `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease` in manual memory management scenarios.  Forgetting to release objects when finished, leading to memory leaks, is prevalent. Double-releasing objects, on the other hand, can cause crashes.  This often occurs when an object is released multiple times, such as when passed to multiple methods that manage its lifecycle poorly. Another example could be improper use of autorelease pools, where the pool is drained prematurely, resulting in unexpected object deallocation and crashes. This can be quite tricky to debug because the timing of the crash can be unpredictable.
